## Summary 
### After reviewing all this data we were able to visualize diferent aspects of the analysis and recreate different points to be considered before we pull the trigger with the project.
### 1. Create incentives for women to use more this service. Also create better deals for the hour slots where we had a decline in the usage.
### 2. The majority of the customers or active users are male so we should analyze the gender demographics in a potencial city we would deploy the projet.
### 3. Build bigger bike sites where the users are riding frequently.
